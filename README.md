# Advent of Code 2021

The project plays around with [**generics**][1] in Go by working through the [Advent of Code 2021 puzzles][2].

## Setting up the development environment

If we're in a future where all goes well, you might not need to run the activation script, but there's no "danger" in doing so as we'll verify its possible to build a go small go package using generics.

To get started, run (notice how it changes PS1 to highlight current session):

```shell
➜  adventofcode-2021 git:(main) . ./goenv/activate
(go1.18beta1) ➜  adventofcode-2021 git:(main)
```

And then once finished to stop using the current version, you can run `deactivate`:

```shell
(go1.18beta1) ➜  adventofcode-2021 git:(main) deactivate
➜  adventofcode-2021 git:(main)
```
